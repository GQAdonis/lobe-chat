# ✅ LOGTO ADMIN CONSOLE - COMPLETE SOLUTION

Based on research from Logto's official documentation and GitHub issues, the problem was that we were trying to serve both the admin console and OIDC API from the same domain, which causes authentication conflicts.

## 🔧 WHAT WAS FIXED:

1. **Separated Domains**: Following Logto's official recommendation
   - OIDC API: https://auth.prometheusags.ai (port 23001)
   - Admin Console: https://admin.prometheusags.ai (port 23002)

2. **Updated Environment Variables**:
   - ENDPOINT=https://auth.prometheusags.ai
   - ADMIN_ENDPOINT=https://admin.prometheusags.ai

3. **Created Separate Nginx Configurations**:
   - auth.prometheusags.ai → port 23001 (OIDC API)
   - admin.prometheusags.ai → port 23002 (Admin Console)

## 🚀 NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE:

### Option 1: Use Subdomain (Recommended)
1. **Add DNS Record**: Create A record for admin.prometheusags.ai pointing to your server IP
2. **SSL Certificate**: Run: `sudo certbot --nginx -d admin.prometheusags.ai`
3. **Access Admin**: Go to https://admin.prometheusags.ai

### Option 2: Use Port Forwarding (Quick Test)
1. **SSH Tunnel**: From your local machine run:
   ```bash
   ssh -L 23002:localhost:23002 [username]@[server-ip]
   ```
2. **Access Admin**: Go to http://localhost:23002

### Option 3: Revert to Single Domain (Alternative)
If you prefer to keep everything on auth.prometheusags.ai, we can configure it differently using path-based routing, but this is more complex and was causing the original issues.

## 📝 CURRENT STATUS:
- ✅ Logto containers running properly
- ✅ Nginx configurations created
- ✅ Environment variables updated
- 🔄 Waiting for DNS/SSL for admin.prometheusags.ai

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTION:
Choose Option 1 (subdomain) as it follows Logto's official best practices and will be most stable.
